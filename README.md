## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Berna, an enthusiastic developer based in New York. 
After a successful career in Category Management and Data Analytics, I transitioned my focus to software development upon relocating to the United States in 2022. 
Eager to leverage my diverse skill set and passion for coding, I am committed to making impactful contributions to dynamic teams within the software development industry. I am **eligible to work in the United States** *without* company sponsorship.
